               <p>Rick Mascitti who was a programmer at the time is credited with giving C++ its name, with the ++ showing an improvement from C programming. 
               But before it was given this name, C++ used to be called "the new C"  because C++ draws inspiration from C, building
               upon its framework while adding new features and libraries to the language.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Object-oriented programming was introduced in C++, this is also known as OOP. 
                Among other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.
                With that said, C++ is unique in the sense that it supports deterministic destructors for classes — a feature that’s not found in other OOP languages.</p>
                <br />
                <p>C++ currently has more than 35 different operators such as arithmetic, bit manipulation, logical operations, comparisons and more.
                Virtually all of these operators can be overloaded for specific types, although there are a few exceptions, one of which is the conditional operator.
                This vast array of operators makes C++ user definitions more like built-in types.</p>
