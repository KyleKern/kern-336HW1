          <p> Java was created by accident when James Gosling was working at Sun Labs, around 1992. 
          Gosling and his team was building a set-top box and started by "cleaning up" C++ and wound up with a new language and runtime.
         Java came into being, but it was originally named Oak.</p>

         <p> The Java language is the second most used programming language in the world, with C being the most used. But over 3 billion things use java programming
             from tv's, to phones, and even Blu-Ray players</p>
             <div />
        <p> The word final actually has 4 different meanings in java such as a class, a method, a field, and a variable</p>
