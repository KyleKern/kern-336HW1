             Python was actually named after monty python's flying circus and was named by Guido Van Rossum pythons creator.
         </p>
         <p>
             Python was made because Guido realized that ABC programming language lacked a lot of features. So he created Python and included features from Modula-3 and ABC

             Python is actually a really easy language to learn because it has simple syntax and is fitted for experts. But it isn't good for people who want to work fast 
             because it has a more basic memory model that it uses as an interpreter.
